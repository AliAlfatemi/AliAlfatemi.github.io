                    My name is <strong>Ali Alfatemi</strong>, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Fordham University</strong>. My research focuses on creating advanced AI solutions, with particular emphasis on <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>bioinformatics</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began my academic career in <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>, working on computational methods for analyzing biological data. In the first year of my Ph.D., I transitioned into <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, focusing on image analysis and machine learning. This work laid the foundation for my current research in developing <strong>deep learning algorithms</strong> for cybersecurity, specifically in <strong>intrusion detection</strong> and <strong>DDoS attack mitigation</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am actively seeking research internship opportunities for <strong>Summer 2025</strong>, aiming to collaborate with research teams focused on AI-driven security solutions. My goal is to leverage AI to address real-world security challenges effectively.
