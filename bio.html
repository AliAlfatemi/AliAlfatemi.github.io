                    I am <strong>Ali Alfatemi</strong>, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Fordham University with a strong focus on developing advanced AI solutions. 
                    My academic journey has spanned multiple fields, allowing me to build a diverse skill set in both bioinformatics and cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my Master’s degree, I specialized in <strong>Bioinformatics</strong>, where I worked on computational techniques for biological data analysis. 
                    In the first year of my Ph.D., I transitioned to <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, focusing on image analysis and machine learning models.
                    Since then, my research has evolved into the development of <strong>Deep Learning Algorithms for Cybersecurity</strong>, particularly in intrusion detection and DDoS attack mitigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am actively seeking research internship opportunities for <strong>Summer 2025</strong> to collaborate with research teams working on AI-driven security systems. 
                    I am passionate about exploring the intersection of AI and security to solve complex real-world challenges.
                </p>
