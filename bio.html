    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Ali Alfatemi, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Fordham University. My academic journey began with a strong foundation in 
        <strong>bioinformatics</strong>, where I worked on various projects during my Master's degree at South China University of Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the first year of my Ph.D., I focused on <strong>computer vision</strong>, developing models for image analysis and visual data interpretation. 
        This experience laid the groundwork for my current research, which is centered around applying <strong>deep learning algorithms</strong> to enhance 
        cybersecurity systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        My current research involves developing innovative AI techniques to combat cyber threats, with a focus on <strong>DDoS attack detection</strong> and 
        intrusion prevention. I am continuously exploring how advanced machine learning can be applied to real-world security challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am actively seeking research internship opportunities for <strong>Summer 2025</strong> and look forward to collaborating with teams working on cutting-edge AI solutions.
